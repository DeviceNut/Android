        The controls affect the PixelNut! device that is currently connected,
         whose name is displayed in the upper left of the screen.

        \n\nYou can change this name anytime by selecting it, which opens an edit box.
        Be sure to confirm your changes by pressing Done, or it will revert to its original name.

        \n\nAt any time you can press the Pause button to stop the animation,
        until you restart it with Resume.

        \n\nChoose Preset Effect Pattern:
        \n\nThis drop-down list allows the selection one of the built-in patterns.
        You can then modify various setting with the other controls described below.

        \n\nThe "?" button toggles the display of a full description of the pattern.

        \n\nAdjust Brightness and Speed:
        \n\nThese slider controls determine the overall brightness of the pixels,
        and how fast the various animation effects change.

        \n\nModify Effect Properties:
        \n\nWhen set to Auto, the ColorHue, Whiteness, and Count properties are all determined
        from the pattern itself. In Advanced designs these properties usually change periodically.

x        \n\nWhen set to Manual you can directly change them yourself with the slider controls.
        Note that some, or all, of these controls may not be active for any given pattern.

        \n\nSelect Force then Trigger:
        \n\nTriggering a pattern causes the pattern to change somehow, depending on the pattern.
        The amount of change is determined by the amount of force that is set with the slider.

        \n\nNote that not all patterns allow setting the force, and some cannot be triggered at all.

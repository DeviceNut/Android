        The controls affect the PixelNut! device that is currently connected,
         whose name is displayed in the upper left of the screen.

        \n\nYou can change this name anytime by selecting it, which opens an edit box.
        Be sure to confirm your changes by pressing Done, or it will revert back to its original name.

        \n\nAdjust Brightness and Speed:
        \n\nThese two slider controls determine the overall brightness of the pixels,
        and how fast the various animation effects change.

        \n\nChoose Preset Effect Pattern:
        \n\nThis drop-down list allows the selection one of the built-in patterns.
        You can then modify various setting with the other controls described below.

        \n\nModify Effect Properties:
        \n\nWhen set to Auto, the color hue and whiteness, and the length properties
        are all determined from the pattern itself, and usually change periodically.
        When set to Manual you can directly change them yourself with the slider controls.

        \n\nSelect Force and Trigger:
        \n\nTriggering a pattern causes the pattern to change somehow, depending on the pattern.
        The amount of change is determined by the amount of force that is set with the slider.

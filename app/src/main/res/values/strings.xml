        This explains how to use the controls, which affect the PixelNut! device that is currently selected
        (name is displayed in the upper left corner).

        \n\nThe Beacon causes a distinctive pattern to be displayed on the device so that you can locate it amongst others.

        \n\nYou can change the name of your device anytime by editing the text.
        Be sure to confirm your changes, or it will revert to its original name.

        \n\nPreset Effect Pattern:
        \nThis drop-down list allows the selection one of the 13 built-in patterns.
        You can then modify various setting with the other controls described below.

        \n\nModify Effect Properties:
        \nWhen set to Automatic, the color hue and whiteness, and the length properties
        are all determined from the pattern itself, and usually change periodically.
        When set to Manual you can directly change them yourself.

        \n\nTrigger Force and Action:
        \nTriggering a pattern by pressing the Action button causes the pattern to change
        somehow, depending on the pattern. The amount of change is determined by the amount
        of force that is applied.
